<h1>About Us</h1>

<h2>Definition</h2>

<p> Citizen journalism is defined as "the collection, dissemination, and analysis of news and information by the general public, especially by means of the internet," by Dictionary.com.</p>

<h2>Who are citizen journalists?</h2>

<p>Citizen journalists are non-professionals who produce and publish news. They may work on their own and share information through social media, a website, or a personal blog.</p>

<h2>What does citizen journalism look like?</h2>

<p>Citizen journalism can be a tweeted photo from the dog park, a livestream from a crime scene, a blog post recounting events from a conference, a video of a tornado and much more.</p>

<h2>Advantages and Disadvantages</h2>

<p>Citizen journalism is community-based, hyper-local, moderately accessible and low cost, shines light on under-reported issues and offers an opportunity for contributors to share their first-hand experience at the scene in the moment. However, there are also some disadvantages to citizen journalism with great impact. Citizen journalism, just like any other type of journalism, can have conflicts of interest and potentially confuse the audience with an influx of opinions. Citizen journalists can also contribute to misinformation through untrustworthy reporting or working unethically.</p>

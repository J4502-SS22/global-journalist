			<h2>About Citizen Journalist</h1>

				<p>This site was created in Patrick Garvin's Multimedia Planning and Design class at the Missouri School of Journalism in Spring 2022. We have been learning about accessibility and usability this semester. One of our learning objectives is to plan, organize and design a website using the concepts we've learned in class. Using HTML, CSS and Javascript, we teamed up to create a website with usability and accessibility in mind.</p><br>

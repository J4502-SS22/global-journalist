			<h2>What does Global Journalist focus on?</h2>
			<p> Citizen journalism is increasing in prevalence. When someone records an event via video or writing, that is considered citizen journalism. The video or writing can be used by professional companies (with permission) to post on their website following a story regarding the same event.<br> According to Oxford dictionaries, citizen journalism is the collection, dissemination, and analysis of news and information by the general public, especially by means of the internet.</p>

			<h3> Ukraine Crisis </h3>
			<p> With Ukraine in the midst of war with Russia, one aspect we have yet to see used in previous battles is the use of social media outlets. Ukrainians have been keeping the rest of the world informed about their country and the war they are facing by providing first-person accounts on their personal social medias. Not only are they informing the public about bombings before the news media can report on it, but they are able to share their feelings on the great tragedies they are facing. One instagram user shared that a friend died due to a bombing close by, and that this war is very real.

			<h3> BLM Protests </h3>
			<p> After 46-year-old George Floyd was murdered in broad daylight by the police, many citizens of the U.S. took to the streets to protest police brutality against Black people, protests that soon led to more violence from many police officers. This was one of the largest protests to take place on American soil, with almost 8,000 protests occuring in over 2,000 locations in 2020. Social media activism was a huge help to push the Black Lives Matter movement forward, with protestors being able to organize and disseminate information faster and across a larger platform than ever before. Livestreaming protests became an important factor to show those who were unable to join what was happening during protests. This not only allowed for the movement to gain a following, but also brought to light those within the police force that were inciting violence, as they were on camera pracitcally the entire time protestors were in the streets.
